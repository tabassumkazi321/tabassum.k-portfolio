## Working With Flourish
First experience working with Flourish - exploratory data analysis of General Govt. Debt dataset from OECD. This visualization was created through tutorial provided.

## My Own Flourish Visualization
Creating my own visualization using what I have learned thus far from lecture and readings.

## Visualization Compare/Contrast

Each visualization essentially represents the same dataset. However, they each portray something different through the type of graph, subset of data, and colors utilized. 

The graph created on the OECD website is only a slice of the entire data. It portrays each country's debt as percentage of the respective GDP in the year 2017. This graph is intuitive and simple because it it is not overwhelmbed with data. The ordering from least to greatest really shows the difference between the highest and lowest debt values. It is clear and not overwhelmed with grids and color. One qualm I have is lack of contrast in color - blue on blue is boring and I don't instantly realize what I need to focus on. The Flourish practice exercise in which we created sparkline really gives each country an individual and holistic view of each country throught time. However, the different timelines and ranges of debt cause a severly innaccurate comparison among all the graphs. 

I chose to do the third part of the assignment using a Dot Plot under the Scatter Plot category. I think this visualization better compares all the locations against eachother, as well as against previous/future years! I used a fading purple color and dot size to visualize the magnitude of debt and ordered it from greatest to least to highlight the countries in the most debt in recent years. I also drew the conclusion in the title of the graph off the bat. I tried to use good design practice in terms of spacing to make the visualization as clear as possible.
