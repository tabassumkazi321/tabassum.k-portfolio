# Week 3-4 Assignment: Critique By Design


## Chosen Visualization

In light of current events, and while in the age in which many people rely on the visualizations spread through social media without checking for accuracy & misrepresentation, I naturally gravitated to seaching for somewhat poorly illustrated COVID-19 statistics. Rather than focusing on (the many, many) visualizations that display outright incorrect data, I hoped to critique and improve a visualization that meant well but could use a push in a stronger direction. I felt as thought this would help my critical thinking, for I am working to improve an already decent graph and need to think hard about payoffs of making certain changes, rather than making obvious aesthetic changes. That is how I stumbled upon this news article from March 2020.

## Critique & Re-design Process

My process began with the critique method from the first half of the assignment. I must say, I found the rating system had me thinking much more critically of the weight of each level on the scale. I felt the need to justify my ratings in detail - and the questions involved purpose and comprehensiveness instead of just visual cues from our previous critique assignment. 

Based on my analysis of the design and purpose behind this graph, I wanted to really showcase something valuable with the numbers involved. The current graph has crowded bars representing two categories of data. I get inundated in the proximity and number of bars due to the many days of data trying to be represented. I want to show a comparison of these two categories (New Cases vs # Discharged Patients) that will lead to drawing conclusions of the daily conditions of disease in Singapore. This led me to sketching a diverging column chart.

This was my final vision in trying to compare the two categories' numbers:

My two sisters were able to interpret my sketch well. When asked if anything was confusing, the pointed out something I failed to realize - a somewhat faulty comparison. Through this exercise, I realize that a better dataset would involve whether these new cases are hospitalized or not; this would provide insights to hospital capacities. Nonetheless, I tried to make an important comparison with the data at hand. 

My final visualization is exactly what I envisioned. With the x-axis in the center, and opposite directions of the two categories, I used red to represent number of cases that day, and blue to represent number of patients discharged. I used red and the negative section to represent new cases simply because of the connotation behind it. The comparision aids a story on how overwhelmed hospitals maybe - whether the number of cases each day significantly overpower the number of patients being discharged from hospitals. To reiterate, it would be more insightful if it was the number of cases admitted to hospitals, but I did what I could with the presented to me. 

## Final Visualization
Creating my own visualization using what I have learned thus far from lecture and readings. I created this using Flourish.
