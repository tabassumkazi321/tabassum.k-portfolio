# Welcome To Tabassum Kazi's Portfolio! 
Fall 2020 Mini 2: 94870 - Telling Stories with Data Portfolio

# About me
Hi! I am Tabassum (she/her)! I'm in the Masters of Information System Technology program and am in my last semester here at CMU. I'm from NYC and hope to pursue my career back home after I graduate. With a background in Computer Science, I'm looking into software engineering, technology analyst, and project management roles. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn about creating effective anecdotes and visualizations that are memorable and really add value to presentations. Even through just my capstone project, I've become keenly aware of the importance of appropriately sharing data to engage the audience. I hope that this course helps me throughout the remainder of my project, and better yet, in the rest of my professional career.
